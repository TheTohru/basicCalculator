basic calculator for java

It is a simple console calculator made for java. After C# language, I did some work for java. I decided to do this and publish it to grasp and understand the language a little more. So, for this application, it has a structure that is both simple and user-friendly. I added the necessary control structures even if the user makes mistakes.

If you notice any errors please let me know.

Also, there are only a few lines of code that are different in the codes I wrote, other than that it is almost the same. But make sure you use the files correctly.
If you want to use it, follow the instructions I wrote below:

name of all files
1 main.java
2 Addition.java
3 Subtraction.java
4 Multiplication.java
5 Division.java

Add and arrange the files in this order, otherwise it may confuse you.
If you want, you can use or develop it as you wish.
